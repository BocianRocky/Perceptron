# Perceptron
The program has been developed for the classification of iris flowers into two categories: Iris-setosa and Iris-not-setosa, using a perceptron. The program allows for training the perceptron on training data, testing it on test data, and displaying classification results.

User guide:

    1. Running the program: To execute the program, run the main program file.

    2. Entering training data: The program accepts training data in the form of attribute vectors describing the characteristics of iris flowers. 
       These vectors can have varying lengths, and there is no limit to their number. Enter the training data according to the instructions provided in the program.

    3. Perceptron training: After entering the training data, the program trains the perceptron using the delta algorithm.

    4. Entering test data: Once the training is complete, input test data in the form of attribute vectors to test the trained perceptron classification.

    5. Classification and results: The program classifies attribute vectors according to the trained perceptron classification 
       and outputs the number of correctly classified examples along with the experiment's accuracy in percentage.
